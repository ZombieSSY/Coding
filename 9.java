2  Divide Two Integers

Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication,
division and mod operator.

Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.

The integer division should truncate toward zero.

Example 1:

Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3
Output: -2
Note:

Both dividend and divisor will be 32-bit signed integers.
The divisor will never be 0.
Assume we are dealing with an environment 
which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. 
For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 231 − 1 
when the division result overflows.

/*
3 Basic Calculator
Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string may contain open ( and closing parentheses ), the plus + or minus sign -, non-negative integers and empty spaces .

Example 1:

Input: "1 + 1"
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3
Example 3:

Input: "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
Output: 23
Note:
You may assume that the given expression is always valid.
Do not use the eval built-in library function.

/*
4 Edit Distance
Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character
Example 1:

Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')

/*
5 Reverse Nodes in k-Group
Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.

Example:

Given this linked list: 1->2->3->4->5

For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5

For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5

Note:

Only constant extra memory is allowed.
You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

/*
6 Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3]
  1
 / \
2   3

Output: 6
Example 2:

Input: [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]

	 -10
	 / \
	9  20
	  /  \
	 15   7

Output: 42

/*
7 Next Closest Time

Given a time represented in the format "HH:MM", 
form the next closest time by reusing the current digits. 
There is no limit on how many times a digit can be reused.

You may assume the given input string is always valid. 
For example, "01:34", "12:09" are all valid. "1œ:34", "12:9" are all invalid.

Example 1:

Input: "19:34"
Output: "19:39"
Explanation: The next closest time choosing from digits 1, 9, 3, 4, is 19:39, 
which occurs 5 minutes later.  It is not 19:33, because this occurs 23 hours and 59 minutes later.
Example 2:œ

Input: "23:59"
Output: "22:22"
Explanation: The next closest time choosing from digits 2, 3, 5, 9, is 22:22. 
It may be assumed that the returned time is next day's time since it is smaller than the input time numerically.

/*
8 Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, 
or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. 
There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. 
You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Example: 

You may serialize the following tree:

	  1
	 / \
	2   3
	   / \
	  4   5

as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
Clarification: The above format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree.
You do not necessarily need to follow this format, 
so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. 
Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.
